## 💡 About Me

I am a **Master’s student in Data Analytics Engineering** with hands-on experience working on **data analysis, machine learning, and visualization projects** across healthcare, recommendation systems, computer vision, and public data analytics.

Through my academic and internship projects, I have built **predictive models**, performed **exploratory data analysis**, worked with **text and image data**, and created **interactive dashboards** to communicate insights. My work includes projects such as **diabetes readmission risk prediction**, a **personalized skincare recommendation system**, a **computer vision–based learning tool**, and **COVID-19 data visualization dashboards**.

I enjoy working on **end-to-end analytics workflows** — from data cleaning and feature engineering to model evaluation and visualization — with a focus on building **practical, well-documented solutions** that translate data into actionable insights.
